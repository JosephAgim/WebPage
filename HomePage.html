     This is my first and last webpage. I will use it to increase my coding skills and maybe host a server. </p>
     
     <p> My name is Joseph, I'm a coffie addict that likes to code games and other useless stuff in JavaScript. My main coding language is JavaScript and
     I study Industriall & Experimental Biomedicin at Link√∂pings University. I will most likely only post about my hobbies and activites of intrest 
    </p>

     I have a main interest in genetic algorithms and artificial intelligens(AI), and how it can come to replace modern medicine method of animal experiments
     through simulations and other programs to make experiments on animals a last resort.
